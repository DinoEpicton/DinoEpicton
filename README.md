- Hi, my name is @Yannic1992
- I'm a polyglot and now after learning several languages spoken by humans, I'm on my way to learn coding to be able to also "speak" to a computer. 
- I started my journey with Java with the goal to create my own Minecraft mod, but until I'm able to do that I will code whatever comes to my mind.
- If you have any questions, you can contact me under my e-mail adress yannic1992@gmx.net
